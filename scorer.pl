# Assignment 4 scorer.pl
# CMSC 416
# Due: Mon Mar. 26, 2018
# Program Summary:
#   A program that calculates the accuracy of word sense tagged
#   text given the text and a gold standard to compare it against.
# Algorithm:
#   Reads the word sense tagged text and the gold standard key and compares
#   them instance by instance to see where the tagged text differs. Uses a
#   double hash to keep track of how many times each possible sense
#   is tagged as every other sense (i.e. how many times phone was tagged
#   as phone, how many times phone was tagged as product, etc.).
#   Uses that data to create a confusion matrix showing all senses and how 
#   often they were tagged correctly.
# Usage Format:
#   perl scorer.pl tagged.txt key.txt
